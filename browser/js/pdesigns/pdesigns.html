					<div class="col-sm-6 pdesigns-text">
						<p>I founded Perrelle Designs (originally known as Evergreen Biotechnology) in 2010 with my brother, Jeremy, after noticing the long lines at our grocery store's bottle return machines (known as reverse vending machines).  After some research, we saw a hole in the market - all of the reverse vending machines on the market were single-feed.  Inspired by the potential to transform the market, while also delivering a social good (by encouraging recycling), we set out to construct the first ever bulk-feed reverse vending machine.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Having no engineering background, the project was ambitious.  We spent months building a working and economical prototype, eventually engaging in discussions with one of the leading companies in the market (Tomra) about or work.  And although Tomra decline to pursue our prototype, it was a great experience, and I learned some very valuable lessons about product development.</p>
